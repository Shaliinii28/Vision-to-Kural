### What it does

Upload any photograph. The system finds the Thirukkural couplet whose **ethical essence** best matches the scene - moving AI from pure **object detection** into **value judgment**.

| Scene | Retrieved Kural | Why it matches |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| A parent watching their child play | *Kural #63 - Makkatperu (Children)* | Parent-child bond as true wealth |
| Friends laughing and helping each other | *Kural #786 - Natpu (Friendship)* | The joy and duty of deep friendship |
| A person meditating alone | *Kural #350 - Thuravu (Renunciation)* | Solitude and detachment from desire |
| A couple separated by distance | *Kural #1295 - Pirividaral (Separation)* | The paradox of love and longing |
| Someone speaking gently to another | *Kural #93 - Insol (Kind Words)* | The power of gentle speech |

### How it works
1. Your image is encoded by **CLIP ViT-L/14** → 768-dim vector
2. A trained **MLP** projects it into a 512-dim shared ethical space
3. **FAISS** searches 1,330 Kural vectors and returns the top matches
4. Results show Tamil text, transliteration, English meaning, and commentary

### Models
- `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14` - image encoding (runs live)
- `sarvamai/sarvam-2b-v0.5` - Tamil text encoding (offline, pre-indexed)
